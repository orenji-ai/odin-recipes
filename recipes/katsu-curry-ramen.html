    <h2>Katsu Curry Ramen Recipe</h2>
    <p>This recipe combines three Japanese favorites: katsu (breaded fried pork cutlet), curry and ramen. 
        Japanese curry is one of the most popular foods in Japan and is inspired by British-style curry. 
        It is mild, velvety and slightly sweet. For ramen, the curry sauce is thinned out with a rich pork broth. 
        All together, the elements of this dish give you a taste of Japanese comfort food.</p>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>For the pork broth: Place the pork feet and bones and chicken bones into a large stock pot and cover with cold water. 
                Put on the lid and bring the pot to a boil. After 10 minutes, turn off the burner and strain the bones. 
                Wash the bones under cold water to remove all the scum. Add the cleaned bones back into a clean stock pot, add water and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Char the garlic, ginger, leek and onion in a skillet until they are almost burnt. 
                Set aside. Place the bonito flakes, dried anchovy and kombu in a spice pack and securely tie the end. 
                Put the ground mushroom into a separate spice pack and securely tie the end.</li>
            <li>Place the charred vegetables, and both spice packs into the pot with the bones. 
                Bring the pot to a boil and boil for 6 hours. Remove the dried anchovy spice pack from the pot. 
                Boil for another 12 hours, then add the salt, sugar and fish powder. 
                Let the broth simmer on low heat for another 6 hours.</li>
            <li>To create the curry broth, take 64 ounces (2 quarts) of pork broth and add the curry bouillon. 
                Bring to a boil and whisk the broth.</li>
            <li>For the pork katsu: Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot to 350 degrees F.</li>
        </ol>
